# Water | Rewrite

<strong>This repository is a rewrite of an older version of the bot.</strong> <br />
<strong>A future version of the bot will present features that were not there before.</strong>

## What are the features?

1. <strong>Convenient file layout.</strong>
2. <strong>Functions not available before.</strong>
3. <strong>Rewritten old features from scratch.</strong>

## How to setup it?

#### NOTE: I (the developer) am not going to help you with the configuration or further work of the bot, as this bot is not intended for use by strangers other than the author of the script.

1. <strong>First of all, clone the repository.</strong>
2. <strong>Go into the resulting project and install the modules using the "yarn install" command.</strong>
3. <strong>Create a "config.yaml" file in the directory and fill in the contents, following the example from "config.example.yaml".</strong>
4. <strong>If you test all the changes using the TypeScript version, use the "yarn start" command.</strong>
5. <strong>If you are going to release the bot for production, use the "yarn start:prod" command.</strong>

## API Keys

#### NOTE: I (the developer) do not provide free keys for the API classes.

<strong>If you want to use the APIs provided by the bot, or want to make your own, you can add keys to the configuration file you set up earlier.</strong> <br />
